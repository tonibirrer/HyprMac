/// `appHint` is another window of the same app's `observed` bound, carried
/// over so a second Outlook window does not have to prove the same floor
/// with its own visible resize. It is stronger than a guess and weaker than
/// evidence: fit checks honour it, the refusal diagnostics name it as its
/// own `appHint` source, and an explicit user request sets it aside the way
/// it sets an `observed` bound aside — it is somebody else's evidence, and

/// front. When a readback survives the learning guards in
/// `FrameReadbackPoller`, the observed size becomes the new known min
/// until a later layout witnesses an even tighter accepted resize and
/// lowers the bound.
///
/// Per-axis evidence is kept per axis. Zero on an axis means nothing has
/// refused anything there, and a fit check reads it as no constraint.

/// A window with no entry of its own starts from its app's hint when one
/// of the app's other windows has refused something. A hint rises on a

/// cannot speak for the app forever. Hints live in memory only and are
/// keyed by bundle id; an empty id names no app, and nothing persists
/// across a restart.
///
/// Hysteresis on both ends:
/// - Record: only raises, and only on the axis the app refused. A seeded
///   hint or an app hint is replaced rather than merged, so an axis nothing
///   refused does not inherit a guess and call it evidence.
/// - Lower: requires an accepted size at least
///   `lowerMinSizeAcceptedDeltaPx` below the current bound — sub-pixel
///   accepts cannot ratchet the floor down.
